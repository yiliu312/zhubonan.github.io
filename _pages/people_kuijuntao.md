## Kuijun Tao
Undergraduate student

My name is Kuijun Tao, and I joined the group as an undergraduate student in 2024. I'm interested in traveling and discovering unique foods in different areas. These experiences not only satisfy my taste buds but also broaden my understanding of the world. I believe that blending academic learning with real-world experiences helps me develop a balanced perspective. I'm glad to collaborate with others and learn in this vibrant environment. Let's take on challenges and create new things together!
