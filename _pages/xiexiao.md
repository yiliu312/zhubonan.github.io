I am Xie Xiao, and I am honored to join Professor Zhu's research team. Professor Zhu is knowledgeable and friendly, and the team has a harmonious atmosphere with excellent research conditions. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at Beijing Institute of Technology (starting in 2024), with a strong interest in the computational design, physical properties, and applications of advanced materials. I enjoy outdoor sports and believe that connecting with nature is a wonderful experience. If you are interested in me, don't be shy. You can reach me at xx_bit@163.com.
