## Zhenhao Qin
Master's student

My name is Zhenhao Qin, and I joined this wonderful group as a postgraduate student in 2023. I am extremely passionate about jogging, as it not only keeps me fit but also helps me clear my mind.I'm a highly motivated learner, always on the lookout for new knowledge and skills. I firmly believe that continuous learning is the key to personal and professional progress. Whether it's exploring a new academic field or mastering a practical technique, I approach every opportunity with enthusiasm. I'm really looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals here. Together, we can share ideas, collaborate on projects, and create unforgettable memories. I believe that through interaction and cooperation, we can all achieve more and grow together.
