## Zhou Jie

Master's student

My name is Zhou Jie, and I am extremely honored to join Professor Zhu's research group and embark on my journey as a master's student.
In terms of academic pursuits, I have a strong interest in analyzing the structure and properties of materials from a microscopic perspective, with a particular focus on integrating machine learning with materials research to explore its applications in the field of new material prediction. I have always believed that interest is the core driving force behind learning and research.
Beyond research, I am passionate about sports such as badminton, cycling, and skiing. I recognize that balancing work and rest is beneficial both for academic research and physical health.
In my future studies, I look forward to continuously improving my research capabilities and academic literacy under the careful guidance of Professor Zhu, while gaining a clearer understanding of my future plans.
