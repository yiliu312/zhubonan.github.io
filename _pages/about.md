I am a professor at School of Aerospace Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, working in the field of computational materials science with wide range of interests in data-driven materials design, discovery.
Previously I was a postdoctoral research fellow (aka PDRA) at University College London, Department of Chemistry.
Trained as an experimental physicist in my undergraduate study at University of Cambridge, but gradually shifted into computational materials science/chemistry over the years.
