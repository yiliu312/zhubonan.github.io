## Xu Cheng
Post-doctoral research fellow

I am Cheng Xu, and I begin my postdoctoral research at Beijing Institute of Technology in spring 2025. I am passionate about fundamental physics, computational simulations, and data-driven science. Excited to join Professor Zhuâ€™s group, I appreciate the supportive research environment and his expertise. I enjoy learning, academic discussions, and collaborating with like-minded peers. Outside of research, I love sports and playing in a band, striving for a balanced life. Feel free to reach out!
