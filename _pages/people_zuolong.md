## Zuolong Jia
My name is Zuolong Jia and I joined the group as a master student in 2023. I am passionate about watching movies, cycling, and listening to music. I am also an enthusiastic learner, always eager to embrace new knowledge and expand my horizons. I believe that staying curious and open to new experiences helps me grow both personally and professionally. I'm excited to connect with others who share similar interests and to explore new opportunities for learning and development.
