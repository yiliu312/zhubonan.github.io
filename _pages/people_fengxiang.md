## Xiang Feng
Master's student

My name is Xiang Feng and I joined Professor Zhuâ€™s team in 2024 as a master student. I'm interested in searching for structures or materials with novel and unique properties. I also want to explore the potential of machine learning models. If you're interested in my research field, please feel free to contact me via email.
