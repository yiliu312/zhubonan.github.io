PhD student

My name is Fu Lei, and I am glad to begin my doctoral studies at the Beijing Institute of Technology in 2025. I am honored to join Professor Zhu's research team. I have a strong interest in advanced materials, particularly those with unique structures and physical properties that can be applied to practical fields. Additionally, I am passionate about exploring the physical mechanisms behind material phenomena.Beyond my academic interests, I am a person who enjoys life, including activities such as playing badminton, cycling, fishing, and savoring delicious food. I firmly believe that a healthy lifestyle forms the foundation for solving any challenge. Under Professor Zhuâ€™s guidance, I aim to push my boundaries and continue improving both personally and professionally. If you are interested in any of my research topics or would like to engage in academic discussions, please feel free to contact me anytime.
